MyKeys v0.1
========

MyKeys is a portable and free custom global hotkey tool. It allows you to use combinations of F1~F12 with letters or numbers to define custom hotkeys (and nothing else), avoiding conflicts with existing software shortcuts. The software is clean, requires no installation, and can be set to start automatically with the system.

Usage
-----

Run the software, create a new F* folder (e.g., F1) in the folder where the software is located, drag the shortcuts of other software (e.g., Word.lnk) into this folder, and press F*+W (e.g., F1+W) to open the Word software. Pressing F*+Enter (e.g., F1+Enter) will open the F* folder (e.g., F1 folder) in the software directory.
